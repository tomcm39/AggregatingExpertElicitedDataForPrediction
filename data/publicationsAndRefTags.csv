This paper explores when it is sensible to perform such elicitation and how that can best be done. A number of key issues are discussed, including topics on which there are, and are not, experts who have knowledge that provides a basis for making informed predictive judgments; the inadequacy of only using qualitative uncertainty language; the role of cognitive heuristics and of overconfidence; the choice of experts; the development, refinement, and iterative testing of elicitation protocols that are designed to help experts to consider systematically all relevant knowledge when they make their judgments; the treatment of uncertainty about model functional form; diversity of expert opinion; and when it does or does not make sense to combine judgments from different experts. Although it may be tempting to view expert elicitation as a low-cost, low-effort alternative to conducting serious research and analysis, it is neither. Rather, expert elicitation should build on and use the best available research and analysis and be undertaken only when, given those, the state of knowledge will remain insufficient to support timely informed assessment and decision making.","Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Morgan, MG (reprint author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",granger.morgan@andrew.cmu.edu,,,,,,77,134,138,3,43,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

In this approach, the carcinogenic risk posed by a specific dose is characterized by a probability distribution, indicating the relative likelihood of different risk estimates. The approach utilizes expert judgment and a probability tree and is illustrated in a case study of chloroform exposure. Experts in cancer biology/toxicology, pharmacokinetics, and dose-response modeling were identified by a panel of science-policy specialists. In a workshop, experts reviewed the chloroform data, received training in probability elicitation, and constructed a consensual probability tree based on biological theories of cancer causation. Distributions of carcinogenic risk were developed based on the probability tree, chloroform data, judgmental probabilities provided by the experts, and classical statistical techniques. Risk distributions varied considerably between experts, with some predicting essentially no risk from 100 ppb chloroform in drinking water while others have at least some probability on risks generally considered of regulatory significance. Estimated human risk was much lower when extrapolating from liver tumors in animals than from kidney tumors. Issues of scientific disagreement leading to different risk distributions between experts are discussed. The resulting risk distributions are compared to standard EPA risk calculations for the same exposure scenario as well as to the expert judgments of epidemiologists about cancer risks of chlorinated drinking water. Issues in combining expert judgments are discussed, and several alternative methods are presented. Strengths and weaknesses of the distributional approach are discussed.

PRA provides a natural venue for the rigorous quantification of structural (model) and parametric uncertainties inherent in predictions of subsurface flow and transport. A typical PRA starts by identifying relevant components of a subsurface system (e.g., a buried solid-waste tank, an aquitard, a remediation effort) and proceeds by using uncertainty quantification techniques to estimate the probabilities of their failure. These probabilities are then combined by means of fault-tree analyses to yield probabilistic estimates of the risk of system failure (e.g., aquifer contamination).

Using data on the six US presidential elections from 1992 to 2012, we report the reductions in error obtained by averaging forecasts within and across four election forecasting methods: poll projections, expert judgment, quantitative models, and the Iowa Electronic Markets. Across the six elections, the resulting combined forecasts were more accurate than any individual component method, on average. The gains in accuracy from combining increased with the numbers of forecasts used, especially when these forecasts were based on different methods and different data, and in situations involving high levels of uncertainty. Such combining yielded error reductions of between 16% and 59%, compared to the average errors of the individual forecasts. This improvement is substantially greater than the 12% reduction in error that had been reported previously for combining forecasts. (C) 2013 International Institute of Forecasters.

Experts often provide valuable information regarding important uncertainties in decision and risk analyses because of the limited availability of hard data to use in those analyses. Multiple experts are often consulted in order to obtain as much information as possible, leading to the problem of how to combine or aggregate their information. Information may also be obtained from other sources such as forecasting techniques or scientific models. Because uncertainties are typically represented in terms of probability distributions, we consider expert and other information in terms of probability distributions. We discuss a variety of models that lead to specific combination methods. The output of these methods is a combined probability distribution, which can be viewed as representing a summary of the current state of information regarding the uncertainty of interest. After presenting the models and methods, we discuss empirical evidence on the performance of the methods. In the conclusion, we highlight important conceptual and practical issues to be considered when designing a combination process for use in practice.","[Clemen, Robert T.; Winkler, Robert L.] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27706 USA","Clemen, RT (reprint author), Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",,,,,,,97,59,59,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"THE PITT BUILDING, TRUMPINGTON ST, CAMBRIDGE CB2 1RP, CAMBS, ENGLAND",,,978-0-52186-368-1,,,,2007,,,,,,,154,176,,10.1017/CBO9780511611308.010,10.1017/CBO9780511611308,,,23,"Psychology, Applied",Psychology,BXL31,WOS:000296286100010,,,,,3/15/19,12,N,N,Y,N,Y,N,N,,0,any categorical or continuous target,mathematical combination; behavioral combination,expert point forecasts or probability distributions,N,Y,Y,Y,Y,Y,N,none,"indepdence,genest and schervish,bernoulli,normal",b'10.1017:CBO9780511611308.010.pdf',review

If the combined effects of climate and land-use change are greater than the effects of each threat individually, current conservation management strategies may be inefficient and/or ineffective. This is particularly important with respect to freshwater ecosystems because freshwater biodiversity has declined faster than either terrestrial or marine biodiversity over the last three decades. This is the first study to model the independent and combined effects of climate change and land-use change on freshwater macroinvertebrates and fish. Using a case study in south-east Queensland, Australia, we built a Bayesian belief network populated with a combination of field data, simulations, existing models and expert judgment. Different land-use and climate scenarios were used to make predictions on how the richness of freshwater macroinvertebrates and fish is likely to respond in future. We discovered little change in richness averaged across the region, but identified important impacts and effects at finer scales. High nutrients and high runoff as a result of urbanization combined with high nutrients and high water temperature as a result of climate change and were the leading drivers of potential declines in macroinvertebrates and fish at fine scales. Synthesis and applications. This is the first study to separate out the constituent drivers of impacts on biodiversity that result from climate change and land-use change. Mitigation requires management actions that reduce in-stream nutrients, slows terrestrial runoff and provides shade, to improve the resilience of biodiversity in streams. Encouragingly, the restoration of riparian habitats is identified as an important buffering tool that can mitigate the negative effects of climate change and land-use change.","[Mantyka-Pringle, Chrystal S.; Rhodes, Jonathan R.] Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Mantyka-Pringle, Chrystal S.; Martin, Tara G.; Rhodes, Jonathan R.] Univ Queensland, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Mantyka-Pringle, Chrystal S.; Martin, Tara G.] CSIRO Ecosystem Sci, Climate Adaptat Flagship, Brisbane, Qld 4102, Australia; [Moffatt, David B.] Dept Sci Informat Technol Innovat & Arts, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Linke, Simon] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia","Mantyka-Pringle, CS (reprint author), Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",c.mantykapringle@uq.edu.au,"Rhodes, Jonathan/C-4841-2008; Martin, Tara/M-1897-2016; Mantyka-Pringle, Chrystal/D-9185-2015","Rhodes, Jonathan/0000-0001-6746-7412; Martin, Tara/0000-0001-7165-9812; Moffatt, David/0000-0003-1170-9464; Linke, Simon/0000-0002-1797-3947",Queensland Government Smart Futures PhD Scholarship; Australian Government; SEQ Climate Adaptation Research Initiative; Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program; Australian Research Council's Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions,"This project would not have been possible without the generous contribution of time and expertise from P.

In order to combine the different opinions elicited, simple aggregation methods have often been used with the result that expert biases, interexpert dependencies and other factors which might affect the judgments of the experts are often ignored. A more comprehensive approach, based on the analytic hierarchy process, is proposed in this paper to account for the large variety of factors influencing the experts. A structured hierarchy is constructed to decompose the overall problem in the elementary factors that can influence the expert's judgments. The importance of the different elements of the hierarchy is then assessed by pairwise comparison. The overall approach is simple, presents a systematic character and offers a good degree of flexibility. The approach provides the decision maker with a tool to quantitatively measure the significance of the judgments provided by the different experts involved in the elicitation. The resulting values can be used as weights in an aggregation scheme such as, for example, the simple weighted averaging scheme. Two applications of the approach are presented with reference to case studies of formal expert judgment elicitation previously analyzed in literature: the elicitation of the pressure increment in the containment building of the Sequoyah nuclear power plant following reactor vessel breach, and the prediction of the future changes in precipitation in the vicinity of Yucca Mountain.

A demand forecast is generated in DSS-DF by combining four forecasts values. Two of them are obtained independently, one by a customer and the other by a market expert. They represent subjective judgments on future demand, given as linguistic values, such as ""demand is around a certain value"" or ""demand is not lower than a certain value"", etc. Two additional forecasts are crisp values, obtained using conventional statistical methods, one using time-series analysis based on decomposition (TSAD), and the other using an auto regressive integrated moving average (ARMA) model. The combination of these four forecast values into one improved forecast is made by applying fuzzy IF-THEN rules. A modified Mamdani-style inference is used, which enables reasoning with fuzzy inputs. A new learning mechanism is developed and incorporated into the DSS_DF to adapt the rule bases that combine the individual forecasted values. The rule bases are adapted taking into consideration the performance of each of the forecast methods recorded in the past. The application of DSS_DF is demonstrated by an illustrative example. The forecasts obtained by DSS_DF are compared with results procured by applying the conventional TSAD and ARMA methods separately. The results obtained are encouraging and indicate that combining forecasts obtained by different methods may be beneficial. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The TDFS process comprises three stages - preliminary data analysis, the generation of quantitative forecasts and judgmental adjustments - which correspond to the three key system components: the data module, the quantitative forecasting module and the judgmental forecasting module, respectively. These stages (modules) interact with one another. This paper focuses on a recent case study that illustrates the functional ability of the TDFS as a support system, providing accurate forecasts of the demand for Hong Kong tourism.

Such aggregated probabilities correspond more closely to the real world if they are transformed by pushing them closer to 0 or 1. We explain the need for such transformations in terms of two distorting factors: The first factor is the compression of the probability scale at the two ends, so that random error tends to push the average probability toward 0.5. This effect does not occur for the median forecast, or, arguably, for the mean of the log odds of individual forecasts. The second factor-which affects mean, median, and mean of log odds-is the result of forecasters taking into account their individual ignorance of the total body of information available. Individual confidence in the direction of a probability judgment (high/low) thus fails to take into account the wisdom of crowds that results from combining different evidence available to different judges. We show that the same transformation function can approximately eliminate both distorting effects with different parameters for the mean and the median. And we show how, in principle, use of the median can help distinguish the two effects.","[Baron, Jonathan; Mellers, Barbara A.; Tetlock, Philip E.; Stone, Eric] Univ Penn, Dept Psychol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Ungar, Lyle H.] Univ Penn, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Baron, J (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Psychol, 3815 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",baron@psych.upenn.edu; mellers@psych.upenn.edu; tetlock@wharton.upenn.edu; estone@sas.upenn.edu; ungar@cis.upenn.edu,,,,,,16,17,18,0,13,INFORMS,CATONSVILLE,"5521 RESEARCH PARK DR, SUITE 200, CATONSVILLE, MD 21228 USA",1545-8490,1545-8504,,DECIS ANAL,Decis.

Operational risk assessment is heavily dependent on expert subjective judgment. Expert judgments can be elicited either mathematically or behaviorally. During mathematical elicitation experts are kept separate and provide their assessment individually. These are then mathematically combined to create a judgment that represents the group view. The limitation with this approach is that experts do not have the opportunity to discuss different views and thus remove bias from their assessment. In this paper, a Bayesian behavioral approach to estimate and manage AUV operational risk is proposed. At an initial workshop, behavioral aggregation, that is, reaching agreement on the distributions of risks for faults or incidents, is followed by an agreed upon initial estimate of the likelihood of success of the proposed risk mitigation methods. Postexpedition, a second workshop assesses the new data and compares observed to predicted risk, thus updating the prior estimate using Bayes' rule. This feedback further educates the experts and assesses the actual effectiveness of the mitigation measures. Applying this approach to an AUV campaign in ice-covered waters in the Arctic showed that the maximum error between the predicted and the actual risk was 9% and that the experts' assessments of the effectiveness of risk mitigation led to a maximum of 24% in risk reduction.","[Brito, Mario] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Ferguson, James; Mills, Richard] Int Submarine Engn, Port Coquitlam, BC, Canada; [Hopkin, David; Pederson, Richard; MacNeil, Erin] Def R&D Canada Atlantic, Dartmouth, NS, Canada","Brito, M (reprint author), Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.",mario.brito@noc.ac.uk,,"Brito, Mario/0000-0002-1779-4535",Natural Environment Research Council [noc010003],,,34,15,15,0,13,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0739-0572,,,J ATMOS OCEAN TECH,J.

New methods of cross validation are applied and suggest that performance characteristics relative to equal weighting could be predicted with a small number (1-2) of calibration variables.

It is generally believed that such problems are caused by the widespread depletion of dissolved oxygen-an indirect result of anthropogenic nutrient pollution. However, the development of scientific simulation models to predict how improvements in oxygen conditions will improve the health of fish and reduce the frequency of fish kills has proven elusive. As a pragmatic solution to this problem, the expert opinion of estuarine fisheries scientists in possession of relevant data and experience was elicited. The relations between joint and conditional probabilities were exploited to translate quantities that are normally hard to assess into quantities that can be drawn more directly from the experiential knowledge of the experts. A combined model of expert opinion was constructed as an influence diagram, and Monte Carlo simulation was used to generate predictions of fish health and fish kills in the Neuse River Estuary under current and improved oxygen conditions. Full model results are expressed as probability distributions, capturing the effects of natural variability and knowledge uncertainty-both contributors to total ecological risk.","Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Div Environm Sci & Policy, Durham, NC USA","Borsuk, ME (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Environm Sci & Technol EAWAG, Dept Syst Anal Integrated Assessment & Modelling, POB 611, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland.",mark.borsuk@eawag.ch,,"Borsuk, Mark/0000-0002-5121-1110",,,,57,14,14,0,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1080-7039,,,HUM ECOL RISK ASSESS,Hum.

Although many methods have been proposed for mathematical aggregation, no single procedure has gained universal acceptance. The most widely used procedure is simple arithmetic averaging, which has both desirable and undesirable properties. Here we propose an alternative for aggregating distribution functions that is based on the median cumulative probabilities at fixed values of the variable. It is shown that aggregating cumulative probabilities by medians is equivalent, under certain conditions, to aggregating quantiles. Moreover, the median aggregate has better calibration than mean aggregation of probabilities when the experts are independent and well calibrated and produces sharper aggregate distributions for well-calibrated and independent experts when they report a common location-scale distribution. We also compare median aggregation to mean aggregation of quantiles.","[Hora, Stephen C.] Univ So Calif, Ctr Risk & Econ Anal Terrorism Events, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Fransen, Benjamin R.] Dept Homeland Secur, Natl Protect & Programs Directorate, Off Infrastruct & Protect, Washington, DC 20528 USA; [Hawkins, Natasha; Susel, Irving] Dept Homeland Secur, Off Policy, Off Strategy Planning Anal & Risk, Washington, DC 20528 USA","Hora, SC (reprint author), Univ So Calif, Ctr Risk & Econ Anal Terrorism Events, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",hora@usc.edu; benjamin.fransen@dhs.gov; natasha.l.hawkins@hq.dhs.gov; irving.susel@dhs.gov,,,,,,27,10,10,1,5,INFORMS,CATONSVILLE,"5521 RESEARCH PARK DR, SUITE 200, CATONSVILLE, MD 21228 USA",1545-8490,1545-8504,,DECIS ANAL,Decis.

Instead of using historical data, the method of nonlinear forecasting enables us to forecast the future number of patent citations and accordingly, to use the forecast as a quantitative proxy for future returns and risks of technologies. Using the Black-Litterman portfolio model, we improve the accuracy of inputs by combining the future views of experts with the future returns and risks of technologies. As a consequence of this, the portfolio becomes strongly future-oriented. With our approach, corporate managers use both experts and data more effectively to build robust technology portfolios.

One of the difficulties is to aggregate a small set of expert opinions with the individual subjectivity or uncertainty modeled with probability theory. This difficult problem is called probability distribution function aggregation (DFA). This paper presents a simple and efficient approach to the DFA problem. The main idea of the proposed approach is that the DFA problem is modeled as a nonlinear function of a set of probability distribution functions, and then a linear feedback iteration scheme is proposed to solve the nonlinear function, leading to a group judgment or decision. Illustration of this new approach is given by a well-known DFA example which was solved with the Delphi method. The DFA problem is a part of the group decision problem. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is also useful to the decision making problem in general. Another contribution of the this paper is the proposed notation of systematically representing the imprecise group decision problem with the classification of imprecise information into three classes, namely incomplete information, vague information, and uncertain information. The particular DFA problem dealt with in this paper is then characterized with this general notation.","[Cai, Mengya; Liu, Changjun; Zhang, Wenjun] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Complex & Intelligent Syst Res Ctr, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Lin, Yingzi] Northeastern Univ, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, IHMS Lab, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Han, Bin] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biomed Engn, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A9, Canada; [Zhang, Wenjun] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Mech Engn, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A9, Canada","Zhang, WJ (reprint author), East China Univ Sci & Technol, Complex & Intelligent Syst Res Ctr, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China.",caimengya88@163.com; yilin@coe.neu.edu; hanbinking1987@gmail.com; cjliu@ecust.edu.cn; chris.zhang@usask.ca,,,China Scholarship Council; ECUST Central University Grant,"This work was supported in part by the China Scholarship Council, and in part by the ECUST Central University Grant.",,40,9,9,3,10,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2168-2216,,,IEEE T SYST MAN CY-S,IEEE Trans.

However, there is an inevitable risk of loss during any mission. Quantifying the risk of loss is complex, due to the combination of vehicle reliability and environmental factors, and cannot be determined through analytical means alone. An alternative approach - formal expert judgment - is a time-consuming process; consequently a method is needed to broaden the applicability of judgments beyond the narrow confines of an elicitation for a defined environment. We propose and explore a solution founded on a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN), where the results of the expert judgment elicitation are taken as the initial prior probability of loss due to failure. The network topology captures the causal effects of the environment separately on the vehicle and on the support platform, and combines these to produce an updated probability of loss due to failure. An extended version of the Kaplan-Meier estimator is then used to update the mission risk profile with travelled distance. Sensitivity analysis of the BBN is presented and a case study of Autosub3 AUV deployment in the Amundsen Sea is discussed in detail. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, current research disregards the important role that the structure of the task, judges' level of expertise, and the number of individuals providing a forecasting judgment may play. Ninety-two music industry professionals and 88 postgraduate students were recruited in a field experiment to predict chart entry positions of pop music singles in the UK and Germany. The results of a lens model analysis show how task structure and domain-specific expertise moderate the relative importance of model and judge. The study also delineates an upper boundary to which aggregating multiple judgments in model-expert combinations adds predictive accuracy.

The Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) procedure was employed to assess the environmental challenges brought about by the western development plans. These plans include five key developmental domains (KDDs): water resource exploitation and use, land utilization, energy generation, tourism development, and ecological restoration and conservation. A combination of methods involving matrix assessment, incorporation of expert judgment and trend analysis was employed to analyze and predict the environmental impacts upon eight selected environmental indicators: water resource availability, soil erosion, soil salinization, forest destruction, land desertification, biological diversity, water quality and air quality. Based on the overall results of the assessment, countermeasures for environmental challenges that emerged were raised as key recommendations to ensure ecological security during the implementation of the GWDS. This paper is intended to introduce a consensus-based process for evaluating the complex, long term pressures on the ecological security of large areas, such as western China, that focuses on the use of combined methods applied at the strategic level.","[Li, Wei; Liu, Yan-ju; Yang, Zhifeng] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Water Environm Simulat, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China","Li, W (reprint author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Water Environm Simulat, 19 Xin Jie Kou Wai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",weili@bnu.edu.cn; lyjbnu@yahoo.cn; zfyang@bnu.edu.cn,,,,,,31,9,10,1,63,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0364-152X,,,ENVIRON MANAGE,Environ.

Both require estimation capabilities regarding the effectiveness of the applied QA techniques and the defect content of the checked artifacts. Existing approaches for these purposes need extensive measurement data from historical projects. Due to the fact that many companies do not collect enough data for applying these approaches (especially for the early project lifecycle), they typically base their QA planning and controlling solely on expert opinion. This article presents a hybrid method combining commonly available measurement data and context-specific expert knowledge. To evaluate the method's applicability and usefulness, we conducted a case study in the context of independent verification and validation activities for critical software in the space domain. A hybrid defect content and effectiveness model was developed for the software requirements analysis phase and evaluated with available legacy data. One major result is that the hybrid model provides improved estimation accuracy when compared to applicable models based solely on data. The mean magnitude of relative error (MMRE) determined by cross-validation is 29.6% compared to 76.5% obtained by the most accurate data-based model.","[Klaes, Michael; Elberzhager, Frank; Muench, Juergen] Fraunhofer Inst Expt Software Engn, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany; [Nakao, Haruka] Japan Manned Space Syst Corp, Safety & Prod Assurance Dept, Tsuchiura, Ibaraki 3000033, Japan","Klas, M (reprint author), Fraunhofer Inst Expt Software Engn, Fraunhofer Pl 1, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany.",michael.klaes@iese.fraunhofer.de; haruka@jamss.co.jp; frank.elberzhager@iese.fraunhofer.de; juegen.muench@iese.fraunhofer.de,"Kl\\{""a}s, Michael/B-6773-2012",,,,,45,9,9,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1382-3256,,,EMPIR SOFTW ENG,Empir.

However, because judgement enters into the forecasting process in an informal way, it has been very difficult to assess its role relative to the analysis of past data. The use of targets in demographic forecasts permits us to embed the subjective forecasting process into a simple time-series regression model, in which expert judgement is incorporated via mixed estimation. The strength of expert judgement is defined, and estimated using the official forecasts of cause-specific mortality in the United States. We show that the weight given to judgement varies in an improbable manner by age. Overall, the weight given to judgement appears too high.

Empirical evidence suggests that averaging model forecasts and expert forecasts could give more accuracy than the individual forecasts do. At the same time, empirical evidence demonstrates that expert forecasts tend to be biased. So, why is it that this average could work? This paper assumes that expert forecasts can be decomposed into a judgmental bootstrapping equation, to be created by the manager, and a part based on unobserved intuition. When the bootstrapping equation dominates the intuition, it is this underlying model for the expert that can make the combined average forecast more accurate.

Using experts in a demand forecasting framework, this work aims to compare the accuracy improvements and forecasting performances of three judgmental integration methods. To do this, a field study was conducted with 31 experts from four companies. The methods compared were the judgmental adjustment, the 50-50 combination, and the divide-and-conquer. Forecaster expertise, the credibility of system forecasts and the need to rectify system forecasts were also assessed, and mechanisms for performing this assessment were considered. When (a) a forecaster's relative expertise was high, (b) the relative credibility of the system forecasts was low, and (c) the system forecasts had a strong need of correction, judgmental adjustment improved the accuracy relative to both the other integration methods and the system forecasts. Experts with higher levels of expertise showed higher adjustment frequencies. Our results suggest that judgmental adjustment promises to be valuable in the long term if adequate conditions of forecaster expertise and the credibility of system forecasts are met.

This research note shows that the PollyVote would have also outperformed vote expectation surveys, which prior research identified as the most accurate individual forecasting method during that time period. Adding vote expectations to the PollyVote would have further increased the accuracy of the combined forecast. Across the last 90 days prior to the six elections, a five-component PollyVote (i.e. including vote expectations) would have yielded a mean absolute error of 1.08 percentage points, which is 7% lower than the corresponding error of the original four-component PollyVote. This study thus provides empirical evidence in support of two major findings from forecasting research. First, combining forecasts provides highly accurate predictions, which are difficult to beat for even the most accurate individual forecasting method available. Second, the accuracy of a combined forecast can be improved by adding component forecasts that rely on different data and different methods than the forecasts already included in the combination.","[Graefe, Andreas] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Commun Studies & Media Res, Oettingenstr 67, D-80538 Munich, Germany","Graefe, A (reprint author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Commun Studies & Media Res, Oettingenstr 67, D-80538 Munich, Germany.",a.graefe@lmu.de,,,,,,17,4,4,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2053-1680,,,RES POLITICS,Res.

In today's dynamic environment, it is especially relevant to consider a combination of both approaches. However, the question remains as to how this combination should occur. This study compares two different ways of combining statistical and judgmental forecasting, employing real-life data from an international publishing company that produces weekly forecasts on regular and exceptional products. Two forecasting methodologies that are able to include human judgment are compared. In a 'restrictive judgement' model, expert predictions are incorporated as restrictions on the forecasting model. In an 'integrative judgment' model, this information is taken into account as a predictive variable in the demand forecasting process. The proposed models are compared on error metrics and analysed with regard to the properties of the adjustments (direction, size) and of the forecast itself (volatility, periodicity). The integrative approach has a positive effect on accuracy in all scenarios. However, in those cases where the restrictive approach proved to be beneficial, the integrative approach limited these beneficial effects. The study links with demand planning by using the forecasts as input for an optimization model to determine the ideal number of SKUs per Point of Sale (PoS), making a distinction between SKU forecasts and SKU per PoS forecasts. Importantly, this enables performance to be expressed as a measure of profitability, which proves to be higher for the integrative approach than for the restrictive approach.","[Baecke, Philippe; De Baets, Shari; Vanderheyden, Karlien] Vlerick Business Sch, Ghent, Belgium; [De Baets, Shari] Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium; [De Baets, Shari; Vanderheyden, Karlien] Vlerick Business Sch, Dept People & Org, Reep 1, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Baecke, Philippe] Vlerick Business Sch, Dept Mkt, Reep 1, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","De Baets, S (reprint author), Vlerick Business Sch, Dept People & Org, Reep 1, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",philippe.baecke@vlerick.com; shari.debaets@vlerick.com; karlien.vanderheyden@vlerick.com,,,Flemish Research Council (the ICM-FWO fellowship); Academic Research Fund of the Vlerick Business School,The authors would like to thank the Flemish Research Council (the ICM-FWO fellowship for author 2) and the Academic Research Fund of the Vlerick Business School for financial support; and Provideor for sharing their data and further cooperation.,,53,3,3,2,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-5273,1873-7579,,INT J PROD ECON,Int.

Yet intergovernmental treaties now mandate the use of sustainable, adaptive harvest strategies, whose development is challenged by a paucity of demographic information. In this study, we explore how a combination of allometric relationships, fragmentary monitoring and research information, and expert judgment can be used to estimate the parameters of a theta-logistic population model, which in turn can be used in a Markov decision process to derive optimal harvesting strategies. We show how to account for considerable parametric uncertainty, as well as for different management objectives. We illustrate our methodology with a poorly understood population of Taiga Bean Geese (Anser fabalis fabalis), which is a popular game bird in Fennoscandia. Our results for Taiga Bean Geese suggest that they may have demographic rates similar to other, well-studied species of geese, and our model-based predictions of population size are consistent with the limited monitoring information available. Importantly, we found that by using a Markov decision process, a simple scalar population model may be sufficient to guide harvest management of this species, even if its demography is age structured. Finally, we demonstrated how two different management objectives can lead to very different optimal harvesting strategies, and how conflicting objectives may be traded off with each other. This approach will have broad application for European waterbirds by providing preliminary estimates of key demographic parameters, by providing insights into the monitoring and research activities needed to corroborate those estimates, and by producing harvest management strategies that are optimal with respect to the managers' objectives, options, and available demographic information.","[Johnson, Fred A.] US Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, 7920 NW 71 St, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA; [Alhainen, Mikko] Finnish Wildlife Agcy, Sompiontie 1, Helsinki 00730, Finland; [Fox, Anthony D.; Madsen, Jesper] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci Kalo, Grenavej 14, DK-8410 Ronde, Denmark; [Guillemain, Matthieu] Off Natl Chasse & Faune Sauvage, Unite Avifaune Migratrice, F-13200 Arles, France","Johnson, FA (reprint author), US Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, 7920 NW 71 St, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA.",fjohnson@usgs.gov,"Madsen, Jesper/J-7853-2013","Madsen, Jesper/0000-0003-3246-0215",European Goose Management Platform Data Centre under African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement; U.S. Geological Survey,"Funding for this project was provided by the European Goose Management Platform Data Centre, located at Aarhus University, Denmark, under the auspices of the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement, and by the U.S. Geological Survey.

This task can be challenging, and in many cases, experts may have greater success making simple judgments about component importance without regard for the variances, covariances, and reliabilities. In this article, it is shown how to estimate the requisite nominal weights when only these kinds of naive judgments are available, and the analytical solution is demonstrated with a small simulation study.

Traditionally, this probability is estimated either relying on experts' judgments or historical data. The estimation may not be accurate due to the subjective nature of the former and the data sparsity of the latter. In this research, a Bayesian analytic approach is taken to forecast risk occurrence probability, combining experts' judgments and historical data. This Bayesian approach consists of four main steps: (1) data collection, (2) modeling prior probability, (3) modeling posterior probability, and (4) multiupdating and analytics. This approach can achieve a more accurate estimation of risk occurrence probability compared with only relying on experts' judgments or historical data because the subjectivity of experts' judgments is mitigated by incorporating observed real data, and the data sparsity is supplemented by experts' judgments. This model is applied to forecast the probability of several critical risks in PPP waste-to-energy (WTE) incineration projects in China, and the results demonstrate its feasibility and applicability for targeted solutions in risk response and allocation.","[Wang, Liguang; Zhang, Xueqing] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Zhang, XQ (reprint author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",lwangah@connect.ust.hk; zhangxq@ust.hk,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71472052],This study is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project 71472052).,,76,0,0,39,39,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

Firstly, one-parameter bivariate copulas are used to analyze rain gauge data in the Netherlands. Out of three models considered, the Gumbel copula, which indicates upper tail dependence, represents the data most accurately for all 33 stations in the Netherlands. Seasonal variability is noticeable, with rank correlation reaching maximum in winter and minimum in summer as well as other temporal and spatial patterns. Secondly, an expert judgment elicitation was undertaken. The experts' opinions were combined using Cooke's classical method in order to obtain estimates of future changes in precipitation patterns. Experts predicted mostly an approximate 10% increase in rain amount, duration, intensity and the dependence between amount and duration. The results were in line with official national climate change scenarios, based on numerical modelling.

In this paper we consider a method, termed the Plug-in approach, for determining the weights to be assigned in this linear pool, in a manner that can be deemed as rational in some sense, while incorporating multiple forms of learning over time into its process. The environment that we consider is one in which every source in the pool is herself a decision maker (DM), in contrast to the more common setting in which expert judgments are amalgamated for use by a single DM. We discuss a simulation study that was conducted to show the merits of our technique, and demonstrate how theoretical probabilistic arguments can be used to exactly quantify the probability of this technique being superior (in terms of a probability density metric) to a set of alternatives. Illustrations are given of simulated proportions converging to these true probabilities in a range of commonly used distributional cases.","[Bolger, Donnacha; Houlding, Brett] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Stat, Dublin 2, Ireland","Bolger, D (reprint author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Stat, Dublin 2, Ireland.",bolgerdo@tcd.ie; brett.houlding@tcd.ie,,,,,,34,0,0,2,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0951-8320,1879-0836,,RELIAB ENG SYST SAFE,Reliab.

This paper proposes a new approach to improving forecasting performance, which takes advantage of expert knowledge by constructing a constraint equation rather than directly adjusting the predicted values by experts. For the comparison purpose, the proposed approach, together with several widely used models including ARIMA, BP-ANN and the judgment model (JM), is applied to forecasting the container throughput of Guangzhou Port, which is one of the most important ports of China. Forecasting performances of the above models are compared and the results clearly show superiority of the proposed approach over its rivals, which implies that expert knowledge will make positive contribution as long as it is used in a right way.","[Huang, Anqiang] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Qiao, Han] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shouyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Liu, John] City Univ Hong Kong, Coll Business, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Qiao, H (reprint author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",qiaohan@ucas.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71373262, 71390330, 71390331, 71390334]; Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities [B15JB00040]","Financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 71373262, 71390330, 71390331, 71390334) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. B15JB00040) are gratefully acknowledged.",,33,0,0,3,26,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0219-6220,1793-6845,,INT J INF TECH DECIS,Int.

Only incomplete information is usually available. The general lack of data describing the behavior of the infrastructure during unwanted events led to estimate their safety mainly from expert judgment. Thus the ability of the expert to predict the level of functioning of an infrastructure for a type of hazard and its intensity is crucial. An error of judgment can have very serious consequences and the production of reliable information requires the ability of the expert to report accurately the uncertainties in its estimations, as well as associated confidence. In order to meet this need, our research within Incertu project (French Ministry of Ecology funding) aims to produce relevant scientific approaches and tools for the collection and processing reliable experts' statements or combined with a confidence level in the context of uncertain information and input data.","[Hathout, Michel; Vuillet, Marc; Diab, Youssef] EIVP LabUrba, 80 Rue Rebeval, F-75019 Paris, France; [Peyras, Laurent; Carvajal, Claudio] Irstea, Res Unit RECOVER, 3275 Route Cezanne CS 40064, F-13182 Aix En Provence 5, France","Hathout, M; Vuillet, M (reprint author), EIVP LabUrba, 80 Rue Rebeval, F-75019 Paris, France.",michel.hathout@eivp-paris.fr; marc.vuillet@eivp-paris.fr,,,,,,18,0,0,1,2,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2267-1242,,,E3S WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,UNSP 03019,10.1051/e3sconf/20160703019,,,,6,"Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Civil; Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Regional & Urban Planning; Water Resources",Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Public Administration; Water Resources,BG8GU,WOS:000392270100037,,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,3/15/19,5,N,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,7,1,The permeability of a levee body,"calibration of experts' assessments, ""...calibration of experts' assessments from the experts' interrogations on the variables whose we know the results (calibration variables).

Experts can however only be expected to assess observable quantities, not abstract model parameters. This means that we need a method for translating expert assessed uncertainties on model outputs into uncertainties on model parameter values. So we use Probabilistic Inversion (PI) method. The probability distribution on model parameters obtained in this way can be used in a variety of ways, but in particular in an uncertainty analysis or as a Bayes prior. In this paper probabilistic inversion problems are first defined, existing algorithms for solving such problems are also discussed and the algorithms based on iterative algorithms are introduced. Those computational algorithms have proven successful in various projects. Such techniques are indicated when we wish to quantify a model which is new and perhaps unfamiliar to the expert community. There are no measurements for estimating model parameters, and experts are typically unable to give a considered judgment. In such cases, experts are asked to quantify their uncertainty regarding variables which can be predicted by the model. Applications to power system load forecasting in NingXia province of China is discussed. This study illustrates two such techniques, Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) and PARmeter Fitting for Uncertain Models (PARFUM) which provide useful tools for the practicing quantities risk assessment. In addition, we also illustrate how expert judgment on predicted observable quantities in combination with probabilistic inversion may be used for model validation.","[Wang, Xiaofeng; Du, Chao; Cao, Zuoliang] Tianjin Univ Technol, Sch Mech Engn, Tianjin, Peoples R China","Wang, XF (reprint author), Tianjin Univ Technol, Sch Mech Engn, 263 Hongqinan Rd, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",wangxiaofeng@tjut.edu.cn; unicorn@vip.sina.com; zlcao@126.com,,,,,,10,0,0,0,2,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-4244-2183-1,,,,2008,,,,,,,718,723,,10.1109/ICINFA.2008.4608092,,,,6,"Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Cybernetics; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Robotics",Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science; Engineering; Robotics,BIQ50,WOS:000262054600136,,,,,3/15/19,6,N,N,N,Y,N,Y,Y,Did not specify in paper,1,power load (KW),"Probabilistic Inversion (PI) method, ""a methodfor translating expert assessed uncertainties on model outputsinto uncertainties on model parameter values""","EJ on Shicaocun colliery, EJ on Hongliujing EJ on HongliujingColliery, EJ on MaiduoshanColliery, EJ on Resident ",N,Y,N,Y,N,Y,Y,the Coincidence Factor,PI method using IPF and PARFUM algorithms,b'10.1109:ICINFA.2008.4608092.pdf',
